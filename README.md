# Joke Cards!

<a name="description"></a>

## Description
Sometimes we all just need a quick laugh. Here is just about the simplest app that was ever made for it. Click the button, and a new joke will be displayed on the card. Many jokes will have a set up and a punchline. When you click the button, the set up will display on the card. When you hover over the card, the card will flip over and behind it you will see the punchline! Simple as pie!
